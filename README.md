# unsloth-cli

Agent + CLI that simplifies fine-tuning with Unsloth, adding complementary actions so an agent can fine-tune models more easily.

## What you get

- **An agent-first CLI** cited from [teken](https://github.com/agentculture/teken)
  (`afi-cli`) — the runtime package has no third-party dependencies.
- **A mesh identity** — `culture.yaml` (`suffix` + `backend`) and the matching
  prompt file (`CLAUDE.md` for `backend: claude`).
- **The canonical guildmaster skill kit** (11 skills) under `.claude/skills/`,
  vendored cite-don't-import. See [`docs/skill-sources.md`](docs/skill-sources.md).
- **A build + deploy baseline** — pytest, lint, the agent-first rubric gate, and
  PyPI Trusted Publishing wired into GitHub Actions.

## Quickstart

```bash
uv sync
uv run pytest -n auto                 # run the test suite
uv run sloth whoami                   # identity from culture.yaml
uv run sloth learn                    # self-teaching prompt (add --json)
uv run teken cli doctor . --strict    # the agent-first rubric gate CI runs
```

The installed console script is `sloth` (the dist name is `unsloth-cli`); run
`sloth <verb>` or `python -m sloth <verb>`. The CLI prints `unsloth-cli` in its
help/`explain` text because that is the argparse program name.

## CLI

| Verb | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `whoami` | Report this agent's nick, version, backend, and model from `culture.yaml`. |
| `learn` | Print a structured self-teaching prompt. |
| `explain <path>` | Markdown docs for any noun/verb path. |
| `overview` | Read-only descriptive snapshot of the agent. |
| `doctor` | Check the agent-identity invariants (prompt-file-present, backend-consistency). |
| `cli overview` | Describe the CLI surface itself. |

Every command supports `--json`. Results go to stdout, errors/diagnostics to
stderr (never mixed). Exit codes: `0` success, `1` user error, `2` environment
error, `3+` reserved.

## Make it your own

1. Rename the package `sloth/` and the `unsloth-cli`
   CLI/dist name throughout `pyproject.toml`, the package, `tests/`,
   `sonar-project.properties`, and this `README.md`. The name is hard-coded in
   ~100 places, so list every occurrence first — see the `git grep` discovery
   command in [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md), the authoritative rename procedure.
2. Edit `culture.yaml` with your `suffix` and `backend`.
3. Rewrite `CLAUDE.md` for your agent and run `/init`.
4. Re-vendor only the skills you need from guildmaster (see
   [`docs/skill-sources.md`](docs/skill-sources.md)).
